objmixer is a script to allow identifying wrong object files, especially useful for debugging a compiler.

Suppose code produced by a compiler with "-O0" is OK, but code produced by "-O2" fails. 
Then we can try to mix the object files from "-O0" and "-O2" to find the wrong object files.

The user need to adapt the obm_plugin.py file to use objmixer.
